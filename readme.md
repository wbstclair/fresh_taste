# Fresh Taste: Serving flavor on-the-fly in Spark

For my Insight Data Engineering Fellowship project, I implemented the incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) algorithm for Spark. The Fresh Taste repository is designed to be run with my customized spark build: [https://github.com/wbstclair/spark] IPCA: [https://github.com/wbstclair/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/feature/IPCA.scala]



This repository contains a higher throughput test of the IPCA implementation, for run-time comparison to the traditional PCA model.
